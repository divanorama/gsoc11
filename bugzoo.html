<h2>svnadmin dump --deltas of a compact history can be huge (by design)</h2>
<p>Roughly the history is like this: create two big files, svn-copy one to another and at the same time
restore the contents (repeat many times). So the second file stays the same but it's history is always
retargeted to the first one and hence the delta is big each time.</p>

<h2>svn special properties (not reported yet)</h2>
<p>There are <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.ref.properties.html">some properties</a>
used by svn itself. svn client has checks for these to be proper, but checks are not complete.</p>
<p>
Example:
{% highlight bash %}
$ svnadmin create repo
$ ln -s `which true` repo/hooks/pre-revprop-change
$ svn co file://`pwd`/repo wd && cd wd
$ touch 1 && svn add 1 && svn ci -m "Add 1"
$ svn propset --revprop -r1 svn:eol-style LF
property 'svn:eol-style' set on repository revision 1
$ svn propset svn:date tomorrow ./1
svn: Revision property 'svn:date' not allowed in this context
{% endhighlight %}
</p>
