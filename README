Here are the code samples for GSoC'11

They come in a form of patch series. Most of
the patches were not created by just me alone,
the credits should also go to the mentors and
to the authors specified in patches. All created
before the pencils down at 22 Aug 2011.

JRN_* patches are picked up by Jonathan Nieder
and included in svn-fe* branches at
git://repo.or.cz/git/jrn.git

WIP_* patches aren't in any upstream yet

All others have reached git master branch.


Another view to the work and to the discussions
is github pages for the project
http://divanorama.github.com/gsoc11/streams.html
It has updates after the pencils down, so there
is also a tag 'gh-pages_22aug', snapshot of which
is in ./_site (don't see how to have this state
published at github pages without creating a new
placeholder project).

The abovementioned page refers to git branches that
I used to track patch series, they are available at
git://github.com/divanorama/git.git


This archive both packed and unpacked is also stored
in github project http://github.com/divanorama/gsoc11
