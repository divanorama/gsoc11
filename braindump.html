<p>Jump in: svn has versioned path/object content and props,
unversioned rev props. However common practice is to deny modifications
to any rev prop other that svn:log, so they are almost stable.
svn:log edits seem to be the most awkward thing to deal with.
Even svn server managing svn:date isn't that awkward.</p>

<p>It is very likely that each svn remote should get it's own
git-notes tree to store unversioned or just per-revision info.</p>

<p>The first milestone is still fetching the whole svn repo root.
And doing a clone and new fetches. <b>git-notes won't be avoided
anyway, so store all the svn revprops there</b>(it's the real coding here),
including the revnum.</p>

<p>Then svn data losses are to be recalled. Tracked empty directories,
unhandled path/file attributes come to mind. Do a quick review
of a possibility to recreate svn dump stream here.</p>

<p>Adjust the code shape and queue it to the list, and go work on the branches thing.
<b>What should be the main point of this submission?</b> It'd be fantastic to teach
git-svn.perl read data from this (or just write a separate conversion tool).
This way the clone gets faster in terms of network and svn server load.
And it also becomes ready for common usage and mass testing.
Another funny thing to do is to run a readonly svn server on top of git data, 
but this toy looks too time consuming.
</p>

<p>Side thoughts: is reword/retime/reauthor rebase/history rewrite fast enough now?
Having it fast is a nice thing, much more options to handle svn metadata.</p>
