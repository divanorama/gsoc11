<h3>Short description:</h3>
<p>Complete the work on git-remote-svn, (re)implement git-svn on top of it.</p>
<h4>Major motivation is:</h4>
<ul>
<li>git-svn git repository is not cloned easily, with git-remote-svn it could be much more straightforward.</li>
<li>git-svn fetch is slow on huge repositories, especially when there are many branches.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project goals:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complete git-remote-svn and get it merged.</li>
<li>Implement the foundation for new git-svn (git-svn-ng) and get it merged too.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Milestones for functionality:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Be able to track whole / as the only remote branch.
Use svnrdump stream for a fast fetch.
Commits will include actual diffs, and some of the metadata 
like svn:author, svn:date translated to git counterparts 
(what should be translated and what not needs some thinking, maybe it'll even be configurable).
Commit history is linear with mutable (by svn upstream, maybe svn:log) and 
svn specific data (rev mapping, revprops) stored separately in git-notes. 
This should be made easy to git clone and proceed with tracking in two git repos, 
and of course not only clone but fetch furter svn updates from a git peer.
</li>
<li>
Be able to commit fastforward linear changes to svn, via svnrdump for better speed.
And be able to dcommit (rebase-push) changes.
At this point it is already possible to try out git-svn-ng for normal work.
</li>
<li>
Be able to track /svnroot/proj path in svn repo in just the same manner as in previous step.
Hopefully svn layer understands paths already making this a quick step.
</li>
<li>
Be able to track paths within svnroot as branches.
The main difference from svnroot branch is how do we choose parents 
(this time whole history could be a tree, not only linear). 
svn cp on path is creating a branch / setting a parent. 
Set of branches to track is either a fixed list of fixed paths, 
or a list of floating path@rev (like trunk@1). 
In the latter case each time a path in 'svn cp'-ed 
we add destination@rev as one more floating path, if it is within svnroot of course.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future development, not included in the minimalistic plan:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Find a way to push and fetch merges to svn. 
svn:mergeinfo could be a good place to store merge parents.
</li>
<li>
Allow path or even revision filters to discard part of svn history. 
Like binaries directory, or a weird svn cp like /trunk -&gt; /trunk/some/path/.
</li>
<li>
Investigate a possiblity to tweak the svn-git mapping and a push process 
such that any (reasonable for svn users) git history can be pushed to svn 
and then fetched back lossless, with the same sha1.
</li>
</ul>
